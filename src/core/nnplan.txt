Alright, let's get started... (Patrick Hein, 29.03.2016)


NETWORK

The network class will be a container and more a less the internal API of the whole thing. The network in its being is
not really important, but what it contains is. The network will contain a Generation container.

To get smarter over time, the Generation container will get talked to by the network, the network container will also
be the manager for mutation chances, strength, etc.

FUTURE PLANS: The network could have a container with general gene improvement ideas which some mutations take examples from,
which could increase learning speed drastically. Each gene in this container would be a small module, replacing a certain mutation.


GENERATION

A generation is also only a container, but this time for Species. The given mutation value to a generation will be shared to all
its species after the end of a generation. After a generation ended, it'll carry its best results to the next generation, and
the very best even get multiplied so the number of species stays consistent.


SPECIES

Species will contain both Neurons, but also Genomes. Given mutation values will be spread randomly to its genomes and neurons.
(There will be neuron and genome mutation values, differentiated from each other)


NEURON

A neuron itself isn't as important as its connections, the genomes. However, a neuron can reject certain connections or
send them signals to decrease or increase their weight.


GENOME

A genome will be the connection between a neuron. They are the key to the network. They need to be changable and can mutate in
the aspect of its connection points, weight etc.
